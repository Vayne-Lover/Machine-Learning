### This is my capstone about CNN.
The pdf is my report.  
The html is ipython notebook recording my solution.  
The ipynb is my source code to generate my notebook.  
In order to let you see clearly,i write ipynb into py.  
I recommend you read the ipynb because it's more powerful to see the result.And i just use the ipynb to save as html.  
Note:If you want to regenerate the result you may need to install caffe first,then you should move cnn.ipynb into the top of caffe.Then you run the code one by one in ipynb you will see how my result generated.
